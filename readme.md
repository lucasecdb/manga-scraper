### Notes for kindle users and automatic MOBI conversion

To be able to use the pipeline that automatically converts the scrapped images
to the MOBI format (kindle format) you need to install the [Kindle Comic Converter](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc),
so you may want to do that before running the crawler.
